In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a car data set with 1435 entries. mplementing statistical hypothesis testing techniques to validate the significance of certain variables resulting in actionable insights for improving performance metrics.
Developed and implemented a comprehensive multiple linear regression model to accurately predict car prices with an impressive 88% accuracy rate. 
Utilized feature engineering techniques to transform raw car data into meaningful predictors, increasing model accuracy by 15% and reducing error rates by 10%
